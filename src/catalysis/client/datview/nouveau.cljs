;; Websockets has to be based on a protocol or something
;; That way we can abstract the communication protocol
;; Or should we just use lamina

(enable-console-print!)

;; db

;; # Note on this namespace!

;; This is really just a fork of the DatView namepsace, which has been separated out to work on a smarter
;; approach to the performance issues associated with the initial implementation of datview.
;; Once things are working here, we'll move it all over to datview and eventaully pull out as a library.



;; ## Overview

;; If om-next gets the idea of components requesting the shape of data they need correct, Datview goes one step further in letting the shape of the data you request direct the rendering of that data.

;; Instead of decorating components with information about where they get their data, decorate _queries_ with information about how they're supposed to render as UI :-)

;; We do this with metadata on parts of our pull expressions and queries

;; Example:

;;     (def small-fonts {:font-size "8px"})
;;     (def small-fonts-bold (merge small-fonts
;;                                  {:font-weight "bold"}))

;;     (def time-entry-view
;;       ^{:attributes {:e/description {:style small-fonts}}
;;         ;; Possible? But not supported yet.
;;         :derived-attributes {:time.entry/duration
;;                              ^{:datview.derived-attribute/of [:time.entry/stop-time :time.entry/start-time]}
;;                              (fn [{:as time-entry :keys [time.entry/stop-time time.entry/start-time]}]
;;                                (- stop-time start-time))}}
;;       [:e/description :time.entry/duration]
;;
;;     (def todo-view
;;       ^{:attributes {:e/tags {:style small-fonts-bold :summarize tag-name-fn}
;;                      :e/description {:style small-fonts}
;;                      :e/category {:style small-fonts-bold}
;;                      :todo/hours {:wrapper todo-hours-with-summary}}
;;         :wrapper [lined-box]}
;;       [:e/name :e/category :e/tags :e/description
;;        ;; Here we have some reference attributes
;;        {:todo/time-entries time-entry-view}
;;        {:todo/subtasks ^{:note "Here merge into the attributes passed down recursively"}
;;                        '...}])


     ;(def todo-view
       ;^{:attributes {:e/tags {:style small-fonts-bold :summarize tag-name-fn}
                      ;:e/description {:style small-fonts}
                      ;:e/category {:style small-fonts-bold}
                      ;:todo/hours {:wrapper todo-hours-with-summary}}
         ;:wrapper [lined-box]}
       ;[:e/name :e/category :e/tags :e/description
        ;;; Here we have some reference attributes
        ;{:todo/time-entries time-entry-view}
        ;{:todo/subtasks ^{:note "Here merge into the attributes passed down recursively"}
                        ;'...}])

;; Functions (components) like `pull-view` are wired together into a recursive tree, based on various entry points.
;; Each one of these entry points is described in the structure of this pull metadata
;; Thus everything is perfectly composable, because everything is just data
;; We can override things so that when we push down into some particular part of a pull expression, the corresponding components will be rendered exactly as you wish :-)

;; The brilliant thing is that we can also just do this if you don't need customization:

;;     (pull-view conn [:e/name :e/category :e/tags :e/description {:todo/subtasks ...}])

;;; Or even better

;;     (pull-view conn '[*] eid)

;; Fine...

;;     (entity-view conn eid)

;; Collections?

;; Yeah, we got that too:

;;     (pull-many-view conn todo-view todo-eids)

;; What about q?

;;     (q-view conn {:find [[('pull todo-view '?todo) '...]]
;;                   :where '[[?todo :e/type :e.type/Todo]
;;                            [?todo :e/category :category/Work]]})

;; This lets us build tables or other collection views using the full expressiveness of DataScript Datalog for scope.

;; Imagine that?
;; Composing queries which know how to render themselves.

;; This gives us the best of all worlds.
;; We'll have om-next style composability, but even better, because the description of how to turn the data into UI will itself be just part of that data and therefor effortlessly composable.


;; ## Global defaults

;; You might have a set of rendering functions, styles, wrappers, etc you want to get applied in a globally default manner, with a few overrides for specific views here and there.
;; No problem.

;; This schema is serializable to the DataScript DB, and can be accessed and operated upon in the component functions.
;; The default functions pull from these.
;; But you can customize and extend them more or less as you wish.
;; And of course, all of these settings are overridable by the metadata specifications on a local basis.

;; This is a new idea... Originally, I was basing things on the entity-view component.
;; But I'm realizing this is bad for the performance story.
;; What we really need is a function that takes data from a pull, and renders all present relationships.
;; This is I think the best way to minimize the amount of querying needed to retrieve data for some entity..

;; ## Security

;; All messages have signatures; or can
;; Can b e used to assert the h8istry of things

;^{:set asside}

;; You can even save your datview metadata-query structures in the database :-)
;; You can build these things atomically
;; It's the perfect backbone, really
;; Subsets fine


;; All rendering modes should be controllable via registered toggles or fn assignments
;; registration modules for plugins
;; * middleware?
